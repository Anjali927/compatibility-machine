# compatibility-machine

Compatibility machine concept based on the "The Button" YouTube series by The Cut. 
Two people determine how compatible they are when asked personal questions about themselves.
If either person decides they are not compatible with the other person based on their answers, they press the photocell and the LED lights up, indicating they are not compatible. 
They begin the game again with another person. If neither person has pressed the photocell by the end of the game, they are compatible with each other.

If photocell pressed, LED turns on
If not pressed, LED turns off
